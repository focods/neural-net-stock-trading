    "## Calcuate Moving Averages and Buy and Sell Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our trading algorithm uses buy and sell signals computed from moving averages of a stock's trading price.  The model uses two moving averages, a fast one and a slow one. The number of periods in the moving average determines whether it is fast or slow. The algorithm considers that the day on which the fast moving average is greater than the slow one is the day on which to buy the stock, i.e. the transition of the fast moving average from being below the slow moving average to being above it is the buy signal. The transition of the fast from being above the slow to being below it is the sell signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below computes these crossover points. In the returned data frame, the `Crossover` column indicates whether the fast moving average moved above or below the slow moving average or maintained its position relative to the slow one. A `Crossover` value of 1 indicates the fast move above the slow, a value of 0 indicates the fast and slow maintained their relative positions and a -1 indicates that the fast fell below the slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm 'buys' stocks on the dates when the `Crossover` value is 1; it 'sells' them when the `Crossover` is -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computations proceed as follows:\n",
    "+ calculate the fast and slow moving averages of the stock's closing price using window size parameters\n",
    "+ determine for each date of trading history whether the fast moving average is greater than the slow\n",
    "+ compare each trading day to the previous day to determine changes in the relative positions of the fast and slow moving averages\n",
    "+ tidy up by removing missing values"
